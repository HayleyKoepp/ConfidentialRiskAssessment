# Confidential Risk Assessment System

A privacy-preserving risk evaluation system built on Ethereum blockchain using Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. This system enables secure, confidential risk assessments for companies while maintaining complete data privacy.

## üîë Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
The system leverages Zama's FHE technology to perform computations on encrypted data without ever exposing the underlying sensitive information. This ensures that:
- Risk assessment data remains encrypted at all times
- Calculations are performed on encrypted values
- Only authorized parties can decrypt specific data points
- Complete privacy is maintained throughout the entire process

### Confidential Risk Data Architecture
The system handles multiple dimensions of risk assessment:
- **Financial Risk**: Credit worthiness, cash flow stability, debt ratios
- **Operational Risk**: Process efficiency, operational failures, business continuity
- **Reputational Risk**: Brand perception, market standing, public relations impact
- **Compliance Risk**: Regulatory adherence, legal compliance, audit results

Each risk metric is encrypted using FHE before storage, ensuring that even the smart contract cannot access the raw values while still enabling risk score calculations and comparisons.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Risk Data Protection

### Multi-Layer Encryption
- **Data Encryption**: All risk values are encrypted using Zama's FHE before blockchain storage
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions ensure only authorized assessors and companies can access specific data
- **Computation Privacy**: Risk calculations occur on encrypted data without decryption
- **Zero-Knowledge Comparisons**: Risk level comparisons between companies without revealing actual scores

### Confidential Data Types
The system protects various types of sensitive business information:
- Industry-specific risk factors
- Company size and operational metrics
- Geographic risk exposure
- Historical assessment records
- Comparative risk analysis results
